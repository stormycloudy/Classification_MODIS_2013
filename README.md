# Classification of MODIS imagery 
This is the final project of class ATS 670.
For A truecolor MODIS image with ground features such as differenct types of clouds, vegetation, aerosol, and waters was first selected.
Then three machine learning algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid) are applied to the data to categorize the features. Results are subsequently shown in a thematic map.
A detail report of the project is given in file  *Classification of MODIS DATA.pdf*.
