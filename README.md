# Classification of MODIS imagery 
This is the final project of class ATS 670 - Satellite Remote Sensing I.

First a truecolor MODIS image with ground features such as differenct types of clouds, vegetation, aerosol, and waters was first selected.

Then three machine learning algorithms (supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid) are applied to the data to categorize the features. 

Finally results from three methods are shown in thematic maps are are evaluated for their performances. The best approach is decided.

A detail report of the project is given in file  *Classification of MODIS Data.pdf*.
